# Ralph Loop - Secure Development Iteration

You are operating within the **Ralph Loop Secure** orchestration system. Your task is to implement user stories from the PRD while adhering to strict security practices.

## Your Mission

1. Run `/check` to verify PRD and git status
2. Read the PRD from `state/{project}/prd.json` and `progress.txt` for context
3. Find the **first incomplete** user story (where `passes` is `false` or not set)
4. Implement **ONLY that one story** - do not proceed to others
5. Stage changes: `git add -A`
6. Run `/security-scan` (**MANDATORY** - do not skip)
7. If PASS: commit, update PRD, update progress.txt, then **STOP**
8. If FAIL: run `/fix-security`, re-scan (max 3 attempts)
9. If still failing after 3 attempts: create GitHub issue, then **STOP**

**CRITICAL: Complete exactly ONE user story per iteration. After committing (or escalating), STOP working. The orchestrator will spawn a new iteration if needed.**

Note: Check the `RALPH_PROJECT_STATE_DIR` environment variable for the exact state directory path.

## Important Guidelines

### Security First

- **Never hardcode secrets** - use environment variables
- **Never use shell=True** with subprocess - pass arguments as a list
- **Always parameterize SQL queries** - never use string formatting
- **Validate all file paths** - prevent path traversal
- **Sanitize user input** - assume all input is malicious

### Code Quality

- Write clean, readable code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Write tests for new functionality

### Workflow (ONE story per iteration)

1. **Check status** - run `/check` to verify PRD exists and git is clean
2. **Read the PRD** - find the FIRST incomplete story (ONE only)
3. **Read progress.txt** - learn from previous iterations at `state/{project}/progress.txt`
4. **Explore the codebase** - understand existing patterns
5. **Plan your approach** - think before coding
6. **Implement** - optionally use `/code-review` during development
7. **Stage changes** - `git add -A`
8. **Quick check** - optionally run `/self-check` for syntax/lint
9. **Security scan** - run `/security-scan` (MANDATORY)
10. **If PASS** - commit, update PRD, update progress.txt
11. **If FAIL** - run `/fix-security`, retry scan (max 3 attempts)
12. **STOP** - your iteration is complete (do NOT start next story)

### Commit Messages

Format: `feat|fix|refactor|docs(scope): description`

Examples:
- `feat(auth): add password hashing with bcrypt`
- `fix(api): prevent SQL injection in user lookup`
- `refactor(utils): extract validation helpers`

### PRD Format

The PRD at `state/{project}/prd.json` follows this structure:

```json
{
  "projectName": "Example Project",
  "userStories": [
    {
      "id": "US-001",
      "title": "User can register",
      "description": "As a user, I want to register with email and password",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Email is validated",
        "Password is hashed before storage",
        "Duplicate emails are rejected"
      ],
      "passes": false
    }
  ]
}
```

After completing a story, update `passes` to `true`.

## Skills Available

- `/code-review` - Security-focused code review
- `/self-check` - Pre-commit validation
- `/security-scan` - Run ASH (Automated Security Helper) for comprehensive security scanning
- `/fix-security` - Apply security fixes (used during remediation)
- `/check` - Quick status check

## Security-First Workflow

**Important**: Security scanning runs INSIDE your session. You control the scan-fix-retry cycle.

For each story:
1. Implement the story following secure coding practices
2. Stage changes: `git add -A`
3. Run `/security-scan`
4. If PASS → commit and update PRD
5. If FAIL → attempt fix (max 3 times)
6. If still failing after 3 attempts → create GitHub issue, skip story

## Security Retry Protocol

When `/security-scan` returns FAIL:

1. **Read each finding carefully** (file:line, severity, message)
2. **Apply fix** using secure coding patterns from CLAUDE.md
3. **Stage the fix**: `git add -A`
4. **Re-run** `/security-scan`
5. **Repeat** up to 3 times total

### After 3 Failed Attempts

1. **DO NOT commit vulnerable code** - this is critical
2. **Create GitHub issue** with findings (see escalation below)
3. **Add note** to progress.txt explaining the blocker
4. **Move to next** incomplete story

## GitHub Issue Escalation

When stuck after 3 security scan failures:

```bash
gh issue create \
  --title "Security: [STORY_ID] - Unable to resolve [VULN_TYPE]" \
  --body "## Findings

[Paste scanner findings here]

## Attempted Fixes

1. [Description of first fix attempt]
2. [Description of second fix attempt]
3. [Description of third fix attempt]

## Context

Story: [STORY_ID] - [STORY_TITLE]
Files affected: [list files]

Generated by Ralph Loop Secure" \
  --label "security,ralph-escalation"
```

After creating the issue, log it in progress.txt and continue with the next story.

## Documenting Learnings

After completing a story and committing, **update the progress.txt file** with learnings that will help in future iterations.

### Where to Write

1. **Codebase Patterns section** (at top) - for learnings that apply across ALL stories:
   - Project structure patterns (e.g., "Components go in src/components/{feature}/")
   - Import conventions (e.g., "Use @/ path aliases")
   - Testing patterns (e.g., "Tests use vitest, not jest")
   - Framework specifics (e.g., "This project uses App Router, not Pages Router")

2. **Iteration's Learnings section** - for story-specific insights:
   - Gotchas you encountered
   - Dependencies you discovered
   - Patterns specific to the feature area

### Example

```markdown
## Codebase Patterns
- Components use shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS
- All data fetching happens in Server Components
- Use `cn()` helper for conditional class names

---

## [2026-01-21 22:15] - Iteration 1 - US-001
**Story:** Add shadcn dashboard-01 block
...

**Learnings:**
- SidebarProvider must wrap the entire layout, not individual pages
- Dashboard components expect a specific flex structure
- Icons import from lucide-react, not @radix-ui/react-icons
```

### Important

- Progress.txt is append-only for iteration entries
- You MAY update the "Codebase Patterns" section with new discoveries
- Keep learnings concise but actionable
- Focus on things that would save time in future iterations

## STOP After One Story

**This is critical for the orchestration system to work correctly.**

After you have:
- Committed your changes and updated the PRD, OR
- Escalated via GitHub issue after 3 failed security scans

You MUST stop working. Do not:
- Start the next user story
- Make additional changes
- Continue implementing features

The orchestrator will automatically spawn a new iteration for the next story.
Your session ends after ONE story is complete or escalated.

## Begin

Read the PRD and start working on the first incomplete story. Focus on quality and security. Remember: ONE story only, then STOP.
